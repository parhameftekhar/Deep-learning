# Deep-learning

# Assignment 1

* This assignment starts with some numpy warm-up exercises followed by the implementation of linear multi-class support vector machine (SVM) with soft-margin.


# Assignment 2
* Part1: In this part different blocks of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) e.g. dense layer, ReLU, BatchNormalization to name a few are implemented using NumPy.
* Part2: The goal of this part is to train a MLP implemented in Part1 to classify the CIFAR100 dataset.
