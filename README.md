# Deep-learning

# Assignment 1

* This assignment starts with some numpy warm-up exercises followed by the implementation of linear multi-class support vector machine (SVM) with soft-margin.


# Assignment 2
* In this assignment multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is implemented and trained using PyTorch to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset.
