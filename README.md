# Deep-learning

# Assignment 1

* This assignment starts with some numpy warm-up exercises followed by the implementation of linear multi-class support vector machine (SVM) with soft-margin.


# Assignment 2
* Part1: In this part different blocks of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) e.g. dense layer, ReLU, BatchNormalization to name a few are implemented using NumPy.
* Part2: The goal of this part is to train a MLP implemented in Part1 to classify the CIFAR100 dataset.
* Part3: In this part a MLP model is trained using PyTorch to classify the CIFAR10 dataset. The goal of this part is to getting familiar with PyTorch main modules such as torch.nn, torch.optim, Dataset, and Dataloader.
