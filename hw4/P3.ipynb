In this assignment, we will implement a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) network with attention, to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. In this section, we describe the training procedure for the proposed NMT system:\n","\n","1. Given a sentence in the source language, we look up the word embeddings from the source embeddings matrix with the embedding dimension $e$.\n","\n","2. We feed these embeddings to the Encoder, yielding hidden states $h_{0}^{enc},...,h_{m}^{enc} \\in \\mathbb{R}^h$ where $h$ is the *hidden size* of the network and $m$ is the length of the source sequence.\n","\n","3. We then initialize the Decoder's first hidden state $h_0^{dec} \\in \\mathbb{R}^h$ by applying a linear projection (called *bridge*) on the Encoder's final hidden state.\n","\n","4. With the Decoder initialized, we must now feed it the matching sentence in the target language. On the $t$-th step, we look up the embedding for the $t$-th word (or token), $y_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^e$ where $e$ is the *embedding size*. Note that during the training procedure where we use teacher forcing, $y_t$ is the $t$-th word in the target sentence. However, in the test stage where we do not have a target sentence, the output word of the model at the previous time step will be used as $y_t$.\n","\n","5. We then concatenate $y_t$ with the combined-output vector from the previous timestep (the gray vector in the illustration below which is denoted by $\\tilde{h}$) to produce $\\hat{y}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{e+h}$. for the first target word (i.e. the start token), previous combined-output vector is a zero-vector. We then feed $\\hat{y}_{t}$ as input to the decoder.\n","\n","6. We use $h_t^{dec}$ to compute **dot attention** over $h_{0}^{enc},...,h_{m}^{enc}$ (please refer to the paper for the details about this type of attention). This will give us a combination of the Encoder's hidden states called the *context vector* (blue vector in the illustration).\n","\n","7. We concatenate the context vector with the decoder hidden state $h_{t}^{dec}$ at each step and apply a linear layer (called *attn_combine* in the code), Tanh, and Dropout to get the next combined-output vector.\n","\n","8. After doing the above procedure for all of the time steps (i.e. generating the combined outputs of all time steps), we will apply the target vocab projection layer to compute scores (logits) of producing different words in the target vocab at all of the time steps simultaneously. \n","\n","9.
